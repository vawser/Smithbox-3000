1400500 Have you met Mr. Gehrman?
1400501 He is an old hunter and advisor to hunters.
1400502 It's all a bit vague now and I can't even see you...
1400503 But still you are in this dream
1400504 …That is his role…

1400652 I don't understand the language but it's cute
1400700 Many hunters have experienced this nightmare in the past.
1400701 The gravestones here are all remnants of them...
1400702 It seems like such a long time ago now.

1400752 It seems like such a long time ago now.
1400800 I heard about the church from some of the hunters.
1400801 A story about God and His love
1400802 But... does the Creator love his creations?
1400803 I am a doll made by you people.
1400804 But you don't love me do you?
1400805 If it were the other way around I would understand
1400806 I love you
1400807 The Creator makes his creations that way...

1402000 (closes eyes and hums quietly)
1402100 (Closing eyes and breathing as if asleep)
1402200 Hunter-sama is it alright to ask you something strange?
1402201 …Have I changed in any way?
1402202 I felt it just now. Somewhere somewhere inside of me a heavy shackle was being lifted.
1402203 It's strange. To begin with I didn't have any shackles anywhere on me.
1402204 *giggle*

1402253 It's strange. To begin with I didn't have any shackles anywhere on me.
1402254 *giggle*
1402300 Ah Hunter. I can hear Gehrman breathing in his sleep.
1402301 Unlike usual when I feel like I'm in pain tonight is very calm.
1402302 …Was there even a little bit of salvation for that person?
1402350 Ah Hunter. I can hear Gehrman breathing in his sleep.
1402351 Unlike usual when I feel like I'm in pain tonight is very calm.
1402352 …Was there even a little bit of salvation for that person?
1402400 ...This grave is the remains of a certain hunter.
1402401 Still trapped in a dream I am still strong and dawn breaks
1402402 …Oh may your awakening be a gentle and meaningful one.
1402450 ...This grave is the remains of a certain hunter.
1402451 Still trapped in a dream I am still strong and dawn breaks
1402452 …Oh may your awakening be a gentle and meaningful one.
1409103 I will make it your strength your blood will.
1409300 Okay. Then let the blood will be your strength.
1500000 Hey you're the new hunter?
1500001 Welcome to the Hunter's Dream. This will be your home even if only for a little while.
1500002 I am... Gehrman. I am your hunter's advisor.
1500003 You may not understand anything right now but don't think too hard about it.
1500004 You just have to hunt the beast. That will ultimately serve your purpose.
1500005 That's what it's like to be a hunter. You quickly get used to it...
1500050 Hey you're the new hunter?
1500051 Welcome to the Hunter's Dream. This will be your home even if only for a little while.
1500052 I am... Gehrman. I am your hunter's advisor.
1500053 You may not understand anything right now but don't think too hard about it.
1500054 You just have to hunt the beast. That will ultimately serve your purpose.
1500055 That's what it's like to be a hunter. You quickly get used to it...
1500100 This place was originally a hideout for hunters.
1500101 The blood transforms the Hunter's weapons and body. It's the Hunter's Workshop.
1500102 Although some of the equipment is now lost.
1500103 Whatever remains is at your disposal.
1500104 ...If you're okay with it then that doll too...
1500200 The moon is close tonight. It's going to be a long night of hunting.
1500201 If the beast is too big and too terrifying for your hands seek the Holy Grail.
1500202 Many hunters have done so in the past.
1500203 The Holy Grail uncovers the tomb of the god and his blood becomes food for the hunter.
1500204 …to receive Holy Communion…
1500300 …I've been dreaming for a long time now…
1500301 I may no longer be able to hunt but that is my role...
1500302 I made a promise to my friends...
1500303 I promise you...
1500304 Coo coo
1500400 Coo coo
1500500 Mmm… Ugh…
1500501 ...Ah Lawrence... you're awfully late...
1500502 …I’m already a useless old fool…
1500600 …Lawrence I’m old.
1500601 I can no longer stand and waking up would mean death.
1500602 It's not much help but there's still something you can do.
1500603 I've been waiting. I want to do something too.
1500604 Hahahaha
1500700 Ah Lawrence.
1500701 How is it? It's burning well isn't it?
1500702 I will forever hold the hunter captive impose a horrible hunt on him and corrupt him with blood and madness.
1500703 This cursed house is no longer needed. Isn't purification the work of fire?
1500704 (off-key husky laughter)
1500800 (off-key husky laughter)
1500801 The whole damn thing is on fire...
1500802 All hunters and their wills! We are finally free!
1500803 (off-key husky laughter)
1500900 …Lawrence this is over too.
1500901 All dreams burn out and Flora returns from the moon
1500902 So hey... let's make our final promise
1500903 No more hunters needed
1500904 You and I will kill each other and whoever survives will be eaten by her.
1500905 That is 3 Wasn't it an ending decided by humans?
1500906 Hey isn't that right Lawrence...
1501000 Many of the Holy Grails are found in the tomb of the gods themselves...
1501001 Very few Holy Grails have been brought back to Earth
1501002 There are many things for which we don't know where they're going...
1501003 If the stories of the nostalgic hunters are still the same today 
1501004 Holy Grail 1One is supposed to be enshrined in the city in the valley.
1501005 But now it’s…
1501006 I heard that it was a city of beasts an abandoned and burned ruin where the beast disease was rampant.
1501007 …A place fit for a hunter isn't it?

1501150 Holy Grail 1One is supposed to be enshrined in the city in the valley.
1501151 The city of beasts... a fitting place for a hunter isn't it?
1501200 The Medical Church or as they are now called the Blood Doctors
1501201 The old hunter and protector of hunters since Ludwig.
1501202 They had their own workshop and made weapons.
1501203 …Many of them seem to have forgotten about being hunters.
1501204 Still it's useful to the hunter.
1501205 So I will pass on to you the words of my ancestors.
1501206 "Go up the Odon Church"
1501300 "Go up the Odon Church"
1501301 ...Up ahead there should be a church workshop.
1501400 Coo coo
1501401 ...Oh Lawrence... Professor Willem... Someone please help me...
1501402 Whoever it is please release me...
1501403 …I am tired of dreaming. I can no longer see anything in this night…
1501404 …Ah someone…
1501405 Ugh ahh...
1501500 Haha
1501501 Setting fire to the workshop...
1501502 Hey you hunter. The night is going to be long and deep.
1501503 You’d better be careful…
1501550 Haha
1501551 Setting fire to the workshop...
1501552 Hey you hunter. The night is going to be long and deep.
1501553 You’d better be careful…
1501600 Yharnam... Forget everything and throw it away...
1501601 Too long too sad.
1501602 You don't think so either...
1501603 Hehehe.
1501650 Yharnam... Forget everything and throw it away...
1501651 Too long too sad.
1501652 You don't think so either...
1501653 Hehehe.
1501700 ...Hunter you have done well. The long night is now over.
1501701 Now leave yourself to my help.
1501702 You die forget your dreams and wake up in the morning
1501703 …and be set free.
1501704 From this damn hunter's nightmare...
1501750 ...Hunter you have done well. The long night is now over.
1501751 Now leave yourself to my help.
1501752 You die forget your dreams and wake up in the morning
1501753 …and be set free.
1501754 From this damn hunter's nightmare...
1501800 ...Farewell excellent hunter
1501801 Fear the blood
1501850 ...Farewell excellent hunter
1501851 Fear the blood
1501900 Hehehe.
1501901 So you too have been consumed by something. The hunt the blood or a nightmare?
1501902 Well any is fine.
1501903 It is the advisor's role to eliminate such people...
1501904 …Learn about Gehrman's hunt
1502000 (The sounds made when attacking. A curved sword and a long-handled sickle. "Humph!" "Haah!" "Kieee!" and many others.)
1502100 (The sound made when damage is received. There are several types such as "Kuh" "Guh" and "Tsssh!")
1502200 (Death throes upon death. There are several types such as "Giiiiiiiiiiii!" and "Ugyaaaaah!")
1502300 It was all just a long night's dream...
1502400 Accept death
1502401 Because the night will be freed...
1502450 Accept death
1502451 Because the night will be freed...
1502500 ...What are you up to?
1502501 If I die you will be the next prisoner...
1502502 What do you want from this damn nightmare?
1502550 ...What are you up to?
1502551 If I die you will be the next prisoner...
1502552 What do you want from this damn nightmare?
1502600 Now I have to wait for the night again
1502601 Hehehe...
1502602 Too late Lawrence...
1502700 …But still hunting is necessary
1502701 For everyone to continue pretending to be someone else
1502702 ...Goodbye Lawrence.
1502703 Blood medicine is waiting to be realized
1502704 …
1600000 ...Hehehe
1600001 Who are you? Are you a hunter?
1600002 Is that so? Wow the story is true!
1600003 I've always longed to be a hunter chasing animals from the hideout of my dreams wearing the scent of the moon...
1600004 Hehehehehe
1600005 I'm Izzy. If you're okay with it bro...
1600006 Can we continue talking here from now on?
1600007 I'm a fool but I'll do my best to help you
1600100 ...Hehehe
1600101 Thank you. I'm glad you talked to me.
1600102 I want to help my brother somehow...
1600103 Hehehehehe
1600104 That's right brother if you're a hunter how about we talk about the Holy Grail?
1600105 Beneath the earth lies the tomb of the invisible god and only the Holy Grail opens the way
1600106 The secret lore of Yharnam
1600107 So that Holy Grail 1However it seems that one remains in the old town.
1600108 The ruins in the valley abandoned and burned ravaged by disease from beasts...
1600109 Even the Medical Church can't get close to this city of beasts.
1600110 Well you're a hunter after all. I'm sure it'll be fine.
1600111 Hehehehehe
1600200 ...Hehehe
1600201 Are you talking about earlier?
1600202 If there's a holy grail left it's in the old town in the valley.
1600203 Even the Medical Church can't get close to this city of beasts.
1600204 Well you're a hunter after all. I'm sure it'll be fine.
1600300 ...Hehehe
1600301 Brother are you from outside?
1600302 Hehehehehe
1600303 You can tell by the words and the atmosphere.
1600304 Besides they say there are a lot of hunters.
1600305 …But it’s nice…
1600306 I was born in Yharnam so I'd like to see the outside world someday.
1600307 …At least it shouldn’t be like this…
1600400 ...Hehehe
1600401 Brother what do you say to that doll sometimes?
1600402 Even though it's a motionless doll it's so so so beautiful.
1600403 So... well I do look at them often but there's no point in talking to them right?
1600404 Hehehehehe
1600500 ...Hehehe
1600501 Thank you. You're so kind big brother...
1600502 …Hehehe…
1600503 That's right brother do you know the story of the church workshop?
1600504 Apparently the upper levels of Cathedral Ward are where the elderly members of the Healing Church live.
1600505 Apparently there's a church workshop next door.
1600506 Since Ludwig became the first church hunter many of the hunters have belonged to the church.
1600507 For them the Church created its own workshops and weapons.
1600508 Of course that’s a thing of the past now…
1600509 You see I like hunter stories...
1600510 This is the only thing I can say...
1600600 ...Hehehe
1600601 Are you talking about earlier?
1600602 Apparently the church workshop is located on the upper levels of Cathedral Ward.
1600603 Of course that’s a thing of the past now…
1609005 I'm Izzy. If you're okay with it I'd like to...
1609102 I want to help my sister somehow but...
1609104 That's right sister if you're a hunter how about we talk about the Holy Grail?
1609110 Well my sister is a hunter so I'm sure it'll be fine.
1609204 Well my sister is a hunter so I'm sure it'll be fine.
1609301 Are you someone from outside sister?
1609401 Sis what do you say to that doll sometimes?
1609501 Thank you. You're so kind Sis...
1609503 That's right sister do you know the story of the church workshop?

2200005 ...But this time is abnormal. In fact the people who are locked up are starting to suffer.
2200006 For a while now the screams of women and the moans of animals have only increased.
2200007 Maybe Yharnam is finished... hee hee...
2200008 But if you find a decent survivor
2200009 I want you to tell me about this place "Odon Church."

2400003 So if you find someone somewhere who is not yet a beast 
2400004 Please tell me about this "Iosefka's Clinic"
2400005 …If they were still human I would protect them as a medical professional. I could treat them.

2400504 And then you help I save we'll get back to normal.
2400505 If you don't want to turn back...

2401003 So... ah it feels so bad... I'm being chosen...
2401004 Do you understand? It's stirring in my head...
2401005 I'm happy...
2401006 Hehehehehehehe...

2401510 ...What a disappointing woman...
2401511 I don't need you anymore
2401512 Where should I go to die?
2401600 (The sound made when attacking. There are several types such as "Deyaah!" and "Eiyaah!")
2401700 Hey because you're a good kid...
2401701 Be quiet...

2409301 I rescued her just now. You told me didn't you?
2409500 ...What a disappointing woman...
2500000 …You…are a stranger.
2500001 Outsiders hunting animals...it's probably not going to be a good thing.
2500002 What's wrong am I the beast or are you the beast?
2500003 Get outta my house!
2500050 …You…are a stranger.
2500051 Outsiders hunting animals...it's probably not going to be a good thing.
2500052 What's wrong am I the beast or are you the beast?
2500053 Get outta my house!
2500100 ...You're so persistent...
2500101 Those kind of people are always a mass of malice.
2500102 It's none of my business. Go away.
2500103 I don't want anything to do with animals or hunting.
2500200 ...You're being annoying. Get out of here!
2500300 …Are you trying to trick me?
2500301 I know. You told that whore where to find shelter.
2500302 What a foolish woman to believe the words of a stranger
2500303 Not only her crotch but even her brain seems loose.
2500304 Hahaha…

2500401 I know. I told that old hag where to find shelter.
2500402 Believing the words of a stranger is truly what an old hag is like.
2500403 Women if you're not young you're nothing but a nuisance
2500404 Hahahaha
2500450 …Are you trying to trick me?
2500451 I know. I told that old hag where to find shelter.
2500452 Believing the words of a stranger is truly what an old hag is like.
2500453 Women if you're not young you're nothing but a nuisance

2500550 ...And what lies have you a cowardly stranger told me?
2500551 You want to trick me? Come on let me hear it.
2500600 …Hmph
2500601 Too bad I'm smart. Who would believe such nonsense?
2500602 That's a lie an ignorant outsider would come up with.
2500603 Hmph…
2500700 Khufu...
2500701 What are you afraid of being found out for your lie?
2500702 That's right that's right
2500703 Even if you are a stranger I will praise you for recognizing a wise person as a wise person.
2500704 Hahaha ahahahaha
2500750 Khufu...

2500752 That's right that's right

2500900 What? You just can't stand liars?
2500901 Okay let me ask you where is safe?
2500902 Hmph…
2501000 …You lying outsider
2501001 See you didn't fool me.
2501002 Come on go away go away
2501003 The stench of a liar is contagious!
2501050 …You lying outsider
2501051 See you didn't fool me.
2501052 Come on go away go away
2501053 The stench of a liar is contagious!
2501100 …Ah so noisy.
2501101 I'm short of blood I'm frustrated
2501102 There's no use in lying
2501103 Get out get out
2501104 Go away!
2501105 2 Don't ever talk to me!
2501200 …Ah shut up.
2501201 I have no use for a lying outsider.
2501202 Come on go away go away
2501203 The stench of a liar is contagious!
2501250 …Ah shut up.
2501251 I have no use for a lying outsider.
2501252 Come on go away go away
2501253 The stench of a liar is contagious!
2501300 ...You're so persistent...
2501301 …Well okay. I'm still generous.
2501302 If you've got blood give it to me
2501303 I'll take that as an apology for lying.
2501304 A chance for merciful repentance.
2501350 ...You're so persistent...
2501351 …Well okay. I'm still generous.
2501352 If you've got blood give it to me
2501353 I'll take that as an apology for lying.
2501354 A chance for merciful repentance.
2501400 …Hehe that’s fine.
2501401 Of course a stranger is a stranger. There's no way he'll be saved in this town...
2501402 ...But well I'll tell you one good thing.
2501403 Be careful of that whore
2501404 I know what you mean. That guy is jealous of the Saintess.
2501405 You probably know better than anyone else how filthy and rotten you are how everyone hates you
2501406 Ah that's why women's jealousy is so scary. It's so frightening.
2501407 Spread your legs you should just get out of here...
2501500 …Hehe that’s fine.
2501501 Of course a stranger is a stranger. There's no way he'll be saved in this town...
2501502 ...But well I'll tell you one good thing.
2501503 You have to be careful of that old hag
2501504 I saw him sneaking out.
2501505 Going out at night to hunt animals is not something a proper person should do.
2501506 Well if that's the case then the rest should be pretty obvious.
2501600 …Hehe that’s fine.
2501601 Of course a stranger is a stranger. There's no way he'll be saved in this town...
2501602 ...But well I'll tell you one good thing.
2501603 Be careful of that blind man.
2501604 I don't know if it was from the beginning or what but I was a cockroach.
2501605 That guy is acting like he owns the place.
2501606 …I don't trust him.
2501607 Or maybe it's to lure everyone to this place...
2501608 There's no way something like that could have lived a normal life...
2501700 …What?
2501701 After all you're just a stranger so can't you even apologize?
2501702 Get out get out
2501703 Go away!
2501704 2 Don't ever talk to me!
2501750 …What?
2501751 After all you're just a stranger so can't you even apologize?
2501752 Get out get out
2501753 Go away!
2501754 2 Don't ever talk to me!
2501800 …Oh don’t lie…
2501801 I know it all...
2501802 Even without education I I...
2501803 There is a special wisdom...
2501900 (Pathetic screams when attacked. Hiii Hie etc. Several types.)
2502000 Uhehehehehe...
2502050 Uhehehehehe...
2502010 Outsiders... dammit...
2502060 Outsiders... dammit...
2509000 ...You're a stranger aren't you?
2509001 Besides being outside on a hunting night makes you infected right?
2509002 Hmm that's scary. A plague god.
2509003 I hope you get hunted down quickly
2509004 Come on go away go away
2509050 ...You're a stranger aren't you?
2509051 Besides being outside on a hunting night makes you infected right?
2509052 Hmm that's scary. A plague god.
2509053 I hope you get hunted down quickly
2509054 Come on go away go away
2509100 …You’re so persistent.
2509101 We are "normal". People like you...
2509102 But you know if there's something you want to ask...
2509103 Bring me some blood and then well... I'll give you a story.
2509104 At this point I don't care if it's you
2509105 It's in the Bible too. "There is no disease in blood no distinction between noble and inferior."
2509106 Hehehehehe.
2509150 …You’re so persistent.
2509151 We are "normal". People like you...
2509152 But you know if there's something you want to ask...

2509155 It's in the Bible too. "There is no disease in blood no distinction between noble and inferior."
2509156 Hehehehehe.
2509200 ...It's you
2509201 Did you bring blood?
2509250 ...It's you
2509251 Did you bring blood?
2509210 ...It's you
2509300 Oh oh oh. Right right.
2509301 ...So is there anything you'd like to ask?
2509400 "Wise Man's Blood"? ... Hmm I don't know. I don't know anything about it.
2509401 Since I don’t know it’s probably just a lie or…
2509402 Maybe the cathedral priest might know something. Father Herbert is very knowledgeable.
2509403 But well that's a pity
2509404 It's the night of the beast hunt and the West Street is sealed off. I can't go to the Cathedral in the East Street.
2509405 Once the hunt is over you the infected person won't be alive anymore.
2509406 Hehehehehe.
2509407 Heh heh
2509450 "Wise Man's Blood"? ... Hmm I don't know. I don't know anything about it.
2509451 Since I don’t know it’s probably just a lie or…
2509452 Maybe the cathedral priest might know something. Father Herbert is very knowledgeable.
2509453 But well that's a pity
2509454 It's the night of the beast hunt and the West Street is sealed off. I can't go to the Cathedral in the East Street.
2509455 Once the hunt is over you the infected person won't be alive anymore.
2509456 Hehehehehe.
2509457 Heh heh
2509500 ...Well the infected have weak brains. I guess we need some mercy.
2509501 I don't know but Father Herbert the priest at the cathedral in the east town might know something.
2509502 If you can why not visit?
2509503 Hehehehehe.
2509600 "Lawrence"? ... Oh you're a stranger just like yourself aren't you?
2509601 know. We headed to the Cathedral in the East on my advice.
2509602 But well that's a pity
2509603 Soon afterwards the bell rang and the night of the beast hunt began.
2509604 There is no way that an outsider can escape unscathed...
2509605 Hehehehehe.
2509606 Heh heh
2509700 ...Well the infected have weak brains. I guess we need some mercy.
2509701 If you're an outsider Lawrence I would have advised you to head to the Cathedral in the East Town.
2509702 Well I don't think he's safe.
2509703 Hehehehehe.
2509800 …Well the infected also have weak brains.
2509801 There's no other way. Go away. Go away.
2509802 Don't pretend to be "normal"
2509850 …Well the infected also have weak brains.
2509851 There's no other way. Go away. Go away.
2509852 Don't pretend to be "normal"
2509900 Bless me cleanse me of the beast's filth.
2509901 Ambassador
2600000 …What is it?
2600001 ...That smell...You're a hunter right?
2600002 …And you’re a stranger.
2600003 If that's the case then just disappear somewhere.
2600004 No fool would open the door on a hunting night.
2600005 Especially to an unpleasant outsider.
2600006 So what happened?
2600007 A hunter? Don't let a beast eat you.
2600050 …What is it?
2600051 ...That smell...You're a hunter right?
2600052 …And you’re a stranger.
2600053 If that's the case then just disappear somewhere.
2600054 No fool would open the door on a hunting night.
2600055 Especially to an unpleasant outsider.
2600056 So what happened?
2600057 A hunter? Don't let a beast eat you.
2600100 …Just disappear somewhere quickly.
2600101 Oh damn it damn it
2600200 ...Oh you're a hunter aren't you?
2600201 So don't you know somewhere safe?
2600202 I know it's not allowed even inside the house anymore.
2600203 You hunters are useless that's why this is happening
2600204 You have a duty to help me.
2600205 Come on hurry up
2600206 Don't you know where it is?
2600210 ...Oh you're a hunter aren't you?

2600250 ...Oh you're a hunter aren't you?
2600251 So don't you know somewhere safe?
2600252 I know it's not allowed even inside the house anymore.

2600256 Don't you know where it is?
2600260 ...Oh you're a hunter aren't you?
2600261 So don't you know somewhere safe?
2600300 Oh I see.
2600301 Outsiders can be useful sometimes right?
2600302 Okay that's enough.
2600303 Your job is hunting animals right?
2600304 I just want it to end quickly
2600350 Oh I see.
2600351 Outsiders can be useful sometimes right?
2600352 Okay that's enough.
2600353 Your job is hunting animals right?
2600354 I just want it to end quickly
2600400 What is that?
2600401 You're useless. Or maybe you just don't need an old hag?
2600402 Ah that's what outsiders are like.
2600403 You probably think we're crazy or something!
2600404 Just disappear! I know!
2600450 What is that?
2600451 You're useless. Or maybe you just don't need an old hag?
2600452 Ah that's what outsiders are like.
2600453 You probably think we're crazy or something!
2600454 Just disappear! I know!
2600500 ...I don't need you anymore.
2600501 So what happened?
2600600 …It's you again. How persistent.
2600601 There's no use if it's useless
2600602 Or have you found somewhere safe?
2600650 …It's you again. How persistent.
2600651 There's no use if it's useless
2600652 Or have you found somewhere safe?
2600700 …What is it with you?
2600701 …Are you trying to make me feel obliged?
2600702 If so then you're missing the point.
2600703 It's obviously your fault outsiders that Yharnam has become like this.
2600704 You must have polluted our blood.
2600705 Stay away! I know!
2600800 Hey! Stay away!

2803610 Oh dear...
2803611 …It seems like it's not safe here either.
2803612 But okay.
2803613 I have nowhere to go and this is where you told me to go.
2803614 Ufufutsu
2803620 Oh dear...
2803621 …It seems like it's not safe here either.
2803622 But okay.
2803623 I have nowhere to go and this is where you told me to go.
2803624 Ufufutsu
2803625 I want to thank you properly but… I don’t think I can do it here…
2803626 And maybe my blood.
2803627 Don't you like women who sell their blood?
2803650 Oh dear...
2803651 …It seems like it's not safe here either.
2803652 But okay.
2803653 I have nowhere to go and this is where you told me to go.
2803654 Ufufutsu
2803655 So you... you want my blood again?
2803660 Oh dear...
2803661 …It seems like it's not safe here either.
2803662 But okay.
2803663 I have nowhere to go and this is where you told me to go.
2803664 Ufufutsu
2803670 Oh dear...
2803671 …It seems like it's not safe here either.
2803672 But okay.
2803673 I have nowhere to go and this is where you told me to go.
2803674 Ufufutsu
2803675 I want to thank you properly but you're a woman...
2803676 And maybe my blood.
2803677 Don't like whore blood?
2803700 Oh dear...
2803701 Sorry. I'm a little unwell.
2803702 So right now blood is... impossible...
2803800 Oh I’m weird…
2803801 Ahh...
2803900 (Moans of excruciating pain. Several types.)
2804000 That's a lie... a bad dream...
2804001 Uh-huh uh-huh
2804100 Uh-huh uh-huh
2804101 Uhuhuhuhu...
2804200 How happy I am...
2804201 Uh-huh uh-huh
2804202 Uhuhuhuhu...
2804300 (Screams made when damage is received. There are several types such as "Ahh!" "Uah!" and "Kyaah!")
2804400 (The pitiful screams of death. "Aaah..." "No way..." and many other types.)
2804500 What did I do?
2900000 …Ah you’re the beast hunter.
2900001 And... it seems like they're from outside.
2900002 I'm Gilbert a stranger just like you.
2900003 It must be a lot of work. The people in this town are all so gloomy.
2900004 I was on the floor and could barely stand.
2900005 If there's anything I can still help you with please let me know
2900006 Cough cough
2900007 …This city is cursed
2900008 I know you have your own circumstances but it would be best if you left as soon as possible.
2900009 Whatever you get out of this city I don't think it's good for people...
2900050 …Ah you’re the beast hunter.
2900051 And... it seems like they're from outside.
2900052 I'm Gilbert a stranger just like you.
2900053 It must be a lot of work. The people in this town are all so gloomy.
2900054 I was on the floor and could barely stand.
2900055 If there's anything I can still help you with please let me know
2900056 Cough cough
2900057 …This city is cursed
2900058 I know you have your own circumstances but it would be best if you left as soon as possible.
2900059 Whatever you get out of this city I don't think it's good for people...
2900100 "Pale blood /Paleblood" is it?
2900101 Hmm... sorry I've never heard of it
2900102 But if it is special blood the Healing Church is the place to go.
2900103 The Medical Church has a monopoly on blood medicine and knowledge of special blood.
2900104 Here across the valley from the city of Yharnam to the east is a town of healing churches called the Cathedral Ward.
2900105 And at the very heart of the Cathedral Quarter there is an old cathedral...
2900106 Rumor has it that this is where the blood of the Medical Church comes from.
2900107 Cough cough
2900108 The city of Yharnam reveals nothing to outsiders.
2900109 Normally you wouldn't even be able to get close...
2900110 It's hunting night. Or maybe it's an opportunity...
2900200 Across the valley from the city of Yharnam on the eastern side there is a town called the Cathedral Ward...
2900201 At its deepest depths lies an old cathedral where the source of blood is said to be.
2900202 "Pale blood/Paleblood I don't know what that is 
2900203 Whatever it is if it's about special blood that might be a clue.
2900204 Cough cough
2900300 I see…
2900301 The only way to get from this part of town to the Cathedral is to use the bridge.
2900302 That's not possible if the bridge gate is closed on the night of the hunt...
2900303 Hmm... then how about a sewer bridge?
2900304 On the south side of the city across the bridge there is a not so good area.
2900305 From there a sewer bridge would have led to Cathedral Street.
2900306 Cough cough
2900307 Normally this is not a place where outsiders would enter.
2900308 Now is a great opportunity for you.
2900309 Right?
2900400 Cough cough
2900401 Across the bridge on the south side of the city there should have been a sewer bridge to the Cathedral District.
2900402 Normally this is not a place where outsiders would enter.
2900403 If the bridge gate is closed that's understandable...
2900500 "Bilgenworth" you say?
2900501 Hmm... sorry I've never heard of it
2900502 It is no longer something that outsiders can know...
2900503 Cough cough
2900504 Sorry it looks like I can't be of any help to you now...
2900505 Cough cough cough
2900600 Hmm... I still don't know anything about "Bilgenwerth"
2900601 Sorry it looks like I can't be of any help to you now...
2900602 Cough cough cough
2900700 Cough cough cough cough
2900701 ...Ah you don't need to worry about me anymore.
2900702 It seems like it's no longer of any use to me
2900703 Finally this...
2900710 In the end it was a worthless item to me but it may be different for you.
2900711 Cough cough cough cough
2900712 ...This is an incurable disease so I came to this city with a glimmer of hope...
2900713 I've survived this long even though I depended on dubious blood.
2900714 Enough already. I'm actually grateful that I'm not infected with animal diseases.
2900715 At least I can die as a human...
2900800 ...Ah you don't have to worry about me anymore.
2900801 Cough cough cough cough
2900900 Ugh... ugh...
2900901 Cough cough cough cough
2900902 Why am I the only one who has to go through this...?
2900903 Oh my god isn't that a bit much...
2900904 Help please...
2900905 help me…
2900906 Cough cough cough cough
2900907 Cough cough cough cough cough cough
2901000 ...Huh what is this...?
2901001 Is it really alright if I take it? It's something very valuable isn't it?
2901002 …thank you
2901003 I didn't mean to do that but I'm very grateful for your kindness.
2901004 I'll be happy to use it.
2901005 thanks so much…
2901006 Ugh...
2901050 ...Huh what is this...?
2901051 Is it really alright if I take it? It's something very valuable isn't it?
2901052 …thank you
2901053 I didn't mean to do that but I'm very grateful for your kindness.
2901054 I'll be happy to use it.
2901055 thanks so much…
2901056 Ugh...
2901100 Swoosh sweep
2901101 Ah I can finally meet you...
2901102 As I promised I lived my life to the fullest... You'll forgive me now right?
2901103 Hey you...
2901200 Yep yeah ugh...
2901201 …Stop it…I’m not…
2901202 Don't come... Don't come...
2901203 …I don’t like blood…
2901204 … I don’t like it…
2901300 Huh!
2901301 What's wrong?
2901302 Cough cough
2901303 Stop it you...
2901310 Huh!
2901400 …It’s not normal anymore.
2901401 Too bad. You're a Yharnam bastard now...
2901402 Cough cough cough cough
2901450 …It’s not normal anymore.
2901451 Too bad. You're a Yharnam bastard now...
2901452 Cough cough cough cough
3000000 ...Who are you?
3000001 It's an unfamiliar voice but somehow it smells familiar
3000002 Maybe he's a beast hunter?
3000003 So please I want you to find my mother.
3000004 It's hunting night so she's looking for her father... and he hasn't come back since.
3000005 I've always... but I'm lonely...

3100001 Oh this time is not normal
3100002 The people who rose up to hunt are now all beasts
3100003 …Don't hesitate
3100004 If you see it it's a beast

3200300 …thank you
3200301 I was attacked by a large man in Cathedral Ward and taken here.
3200302 There were many other people there but they were all taken away.
3200303 ...And ever since then all I've heard from afar is cries of wailing...
3200400 ...Tonight is the night for hunting right?
3200401 It's dangerous outside... and the houses are keeping their doors tightly closed...
3200402 Maybe it's not something I should ask you
3200403 Do you know anywhere that would accept me?
3200500 …Oh thank you.
3200501 Well then I'll take a look at the opportunity and head over there.
3200502 I pray for success in your hunt.

3202200 (Screams made when damage is received. There are several types such as "Ahh!" "Uah!" and "Kyaah!")
3202300 (Pitiful screams when dying. "Aaahhh..." "Oh my God..." and several other types.)

3202700 Now I'll save you...
3202750 Now I'll save you...
3300000 Hunter didn't you read the warning?
3300001 Turn back.
3300002 The old town is a city of beasts and after being burned down they are just living in their cages.
3300003 What harm could it do to the people above?
3300004 Turn back.
3300005 …or we will hunt you down
3300050 Hunter didn't you read the warning?
3300051 Turn back.
3300052 The old town is a city of beasts and after being burned down they are just living in their cages.
3300053 What harm could it do to the people above?
3300054 Turn back.
3300055 …or we will hunt you down
3300100 ...You're a good hunter.
3300101 He is skilled at hunting ruthless and blood-drunk. He is a good hunter.
3300110 That is why I must hunt you down!
3300150 ...You're a good hunter.
3300151 He is skilled at hunting ruthless and blood-drunk. He is a good hunter.
3300160 That is why I must hunt you down!
3300200 Do you still dream my lord?
3300201 If so you should reconsider that.
3300300 Remember my lord you are not hunting any beasts.
3300400 ...Oh my lord...where did you come from?
3300401 Well okay.
3300402 What are you doing in the old town my lord?
3300403 I don't know what's going on up there but I'll leave it here.
3300404 The beasts can't go up there they won't bother anyone.
3300405 But still if you hunt them... I will hunt you.
3300406 What do you think?
3300450 ...Oh my lord...where did you come from?
3300451 Well okay.
3300452 What are you doing in the old town my lord?
3300453 I don't know what's going on up there but I'll leave it here.
3300454 The beasts can't go up there they won't bother anyone.
3300455 But still if you hunt them... I will hunt you.
3300456 What do you think?
3300500 …I see. That's good then.
3300501 I don't dream about it anymore but I was once a hunter.
3300502 Hunting the hunter is just an abomination.
3300503 Just remember
3300504 You are not hunting animals. That is... a human.
3300505 You too will remember someday...
3300506 …Now go away.
3300507 This is a farewell gift for my junior. In any case I don't need it anymore.
3300600 What's wrong? A hunter needs no repetition.
3300601 Come on go already.
3300602 Dreaming is for one night. Don't regret it.
3300700 …I see I guess so.
3300701 You are a good hunter and I must hunt you!
3300750 …I see I guess so.
3300751 You are a good hunter and I must hunt you!
3300800 You coward!
3300801 I see he was the perfect man for hunting humans!
3300802 Well then there's no need to hesitate!
3300803 Become food for the beasts!
3300850 You coward!
3300851 I see she was a woman suited to hunting humans!
3300852 Well then there's no need to hesitate!
3300853 Become food for the beasts!
3300900 …Your Excellency are you drunk with blood or madness?
3300901 The weak-hearted should not be hunters.
3300902 Let me hunt!
3300950 …Your Excellency are you drunk with blood or madness?
3300951 The weak-hearted should not be hunters.
3300952 Let me hunt!
3301000 Do you still dream my lord?
3301001 …You can come as many times as you like. Each time I'll reduce the pain of death.
3301010 Even animals will eventually learn pain
3301100 ...You... you are the beast...
3301101 You should realize this sooner. You're already going crazy...
3301200 (The sound made when attacking. A saw-tooth hatchet. There are several types such as "Humph!" "Haah!" and "Kieee!".)
3301300 (The sound made when damage is received. There are several types such as "Kuh" "Guh" and "Tsssh!")
3301400 (Death throes upon death. There are several types such as "Giiiiiiiiiiii!" and "Ugyaaaaah!")
3301500 Do you understand my lord?
3301501 Even beasts were once human
3301502 Wouldn't it be best if we didn't have to hunt?
3301503 why?
3301504 Why do you need to hunt us?
3301505 Trapped in the old town...
3301506 So what's the problem?
3301507 You still hunt us.
3301508 That must be your obsession!
3301550 Do you understand my lord?
3301551 Even beasts were once human
3301552 Wouldn't it be best if we didn't have to hunt?
3301553 why?
3301554 Why do you need to hunt us?
3301555 Trapped in the old town...
3301556 So what's the problem?
3301557 You still hunt us.
3301558 That must be your obsession!
3400000 ...Are you a beast hunter?
3400001 Ah yes. I used to be like that too.
3400002 Sorry for the late introduction I'm Alfred.
3400003 Now I follow the teachings of Master Logarius and hunt down the corrupted bloodline.
3400004 What do you think? Although our targets are different we are both hunters.
3400005 What do you mean by cooperating and exchanging information from now on?
3400050 ...Are you a beast hunter?
3400051 Ah yes. I used to be like that too.
3400052 Sorry for the late introduction I'm Alfred.
3400053 Now I follow the teachings of Master Logarius and hunt down the corrupted bloodline.
3400054 What do you think? Although our targets are different we are both hunters.
3400055 What do you mean by cooperating and exchanging information from now on?
3400100 Oh! Well then thank you very much.
3400105 This is a sign of familiarity.
3400110 Hunting animals is a noble profession. May the blessings of blood be upon you.
3400120 Oh you were safe.
3400121 This is a sign of familiarity.
3400200 …I see that’s unfortunate.
3400201 If you change your mind please call again.
3400202 Tonight is the night of the hunt and we are both hunters
3400250 …I see that’s unfortunate.
3400251 If you change your mind please call again.
3400252 Tonight is the night of the hunt and we are both hunters
3400300 Oh you changed your mind?
3400301 If so let's work together and share information.
3400400 So let's exchange information.
3400401 If there's anything you'd like to know feel free to ask
3400500 Oh you were safe.
3400501 So let's exchange information.
3400502 If there's anything you'd like to know feel free to ask
3400600 As you know the Medical Church is the bearer of blood salvation.
3400601 However a hunter like me doesn't know much about the inner workings of the church...
3400602 I have heard that the blood of salvation and its source the Eucharist is enshrined in the Cathedral.
3400603 The upper levels of Cathedral Ward are also home to the leaders of the old church.
3400604 If you are seeking blood salvation and are forgiven I think it would be a good idea to visit.
3400700 Byrgenwerth is an old school
3400701 Hunters know that the Graveyard of the Gods lies deep beneath Yharnam.
3400702 Some former students of Byrgenwerth brought back a sacred relic from the cemetery.
3400703 And so the Medical Church and Blood Salvation were born.
3400704 In other words Byrgenworth is the beginning of what made Yharnam a holy land.
3400705 I hear it has now been abandoned and buried deep in the forest.
3400706 …And Byrgenwerth is off-limits to the Healing Church.
3400707 It is unclear how many of these former students are still alive.
3400708 The gatekeepers will not open the gate unless you give them the password that only they know.
3400800 …The old town was once a place ravaged by animal disease and abandoned.
3400801 It has been sealed off ever since with no traffic and only the roars of beasts being heard.
3400802 It is said that one of the Holy Grails that opens the Graveyard of the Gods remains in that place.
3400803 The Holy Grail in the Old Town has long been one of the Church's aims...
3400804 The reason we haven't heard anything about it yet is that there may be some obstacles.
3400900 Oh I'll tell you too
3400901 The great Master Logarius said:
3400902 There was once a traitor at Byrgenwerth's school.
3400903 Brought the forbidden blood back to Cainhurst Castle
3400904 And so a non-human impure bloodline was born.
3400905 …Bloodline people are an unforgivable presence that taints and infringes on the blood salvation of the Medical Church.
3400906 The family the head of the family is still alive today.
3400907 That's why I'm searching to carry on my master's wishes.
3400908 On the road to Cainhurst...
3401000 Master Logarius once led an execution squad to cleanse the bloodline at Cainhurst Castle.
3401001 However all of his wishes were unfulfilled and so he became a martyr to serve as a weight of salvation.
3401002 …It is deplorable.
3401003 A great master imprisoned by a tainted bloodline by a cursed land.
3401004 I want to free him. I want him to be honored as a canonized martyr.
3401100 …Oh this is… the Sigil of Cainhurst…
3401101 I have heard that the nobles of Cainhurst once used these pretentious invitations.
3401102 …Amazing…Thank you…
3401103 I'll be out soon. Before that I want to give you a token of my appreciation.
3401110 …Ah perhaps this is also my master's will…
3401111 Thank you for the protection of blood
3401112 Let's keep this city clean together...
3401200 Until next time. It was a fun conversation.
3401201 May the blessings of blood be upon you.
3401300 It was nice meeting you. Goodbye.
3401301 May the blessings of blood be upon you.
3401302 Let's keep this city clean together...
3401400 Behold Master! I have done it I have done it!
3401401 I crushed and crushed and crushed this filthy woman turning her into a pink lump of flesh!
3401402 How about that you whore!
3401403 No matter how immortal you are if you continue to live like this forever you will not be deceived by anything!
3401404 The way you expose your entire insides your mucous membranes is just perfect for you your naughty self!
3401405 Haha hahaha
3401406 Hahahahahaha!
3401500 (laughing tiredly)
3401501 …Oh it was you!
3401502 Look! Thanks to you I finally did it!
3401503 How about that? Isn't that wonderful? Now we can canonize our master as a sainted martyr!
3401504 Haha hahaha
3401505 I did it!!
3401506 Hahahahahaha!
3401510 Haha hahaha
3401511 I did it!!
3401512 Hahahahahaha!
3401600 …What do you mean?
3401601 Why are you pointing your blade at me?
3401610 …What do you mean?
3401611 Why are you pointing your blade at me?
3401620 Jealousy! Are you jealous?
3401700 Please help me worship my master...
3401750 Please help me worship my master...
3401800 ...Hunter jealousy is ugly.
3401801 You go ahead with your hunt.
3401802 Like me...
3401810 Hahahahahaha!
3401850 ...Hunter jealousy is ugly.
3401851 You go ahead with your hunt.
3401852 Like me...
3401900 (The sound made when attacking. Heavy weapons. "Nuuuun!" "Doryaa!" and several other sounds.)
3401901 (The sound of attacking. Heavy weapons. "Die!" "Crush!" and many more.)
3402000 (The sound made when damage is received. There are several types such as "Guuh" and "Gwaaah")
3402100 Whore!

3402200 (Death throes upon death. There are several types such as "Giiiiiiiiiiii!" and "Ugyaaaaah!")
3402300 You... you'll regret it...
3402310 You... you'll regret it...
3402400 It would be shameful to be engulfed in blood...
3402401 Kkkkkkkk...
3402450 It would be shameful to be engulfed in blood...

3402600 Oh are you okay?
3402601 That was good
3402602 Let's both succeed in the hunt
3402650 Oh are you okay?
3402651 That was good
3402652 Let's both succeed in the hunt
3402700 (Snoring while sleeping)
3500000 ...Oh you're a hunter...And you're from outside right?
3500001 I've been caught up in some terrible things. Tonight it's been terrible.
3500002 This is a farewell gift for my juniors.
3500050 ...Oh you're a hunter...And you're from outside right?
3500051 I've been caught up in some terrible things. Tonight it's been terrible.
3500052 This is a farewell gift for my juniors.
3500010 …Stand strong.
3500011 None of us are human anymore. We're just man-eating beasts...
3500100 What you're still here?
3500101 What's wrong? Are you afraid of the hunter or the beast?
3500102 Hehe
3500103 Oh well. What difference does a fearless hunter make to a beast?
3500150 What you're still here?
3500151 What's wrong? Are you afraid of the hunter or the beast?
3500152 Hehe
3500153 Oh well. What difference does a fearless hunter make to a beast?
3500200 What's up with you? You're so persistent.
3500201 No matter how scary it may be you are a hunter.
3500202 I have no choice but to hunt the beast...
3500250 What's up with you? You're so persistent.
3500251 No matter how scary it may be you are a hunter.
3500252 I have no choice but to hunt the beast...
3500300 Oh it's you
3500301 Good. There's a warning.
3500302 Stay away from the Catacombs of the Odon Church in the Cathedral Ward.
3500303 Henrik...the old hunter has lost his mind
3500304 That is my prey...
3500400 Stay away from the Catacombs of the Odon Church in the Cathedral Ward.
3500401 That is my prey...
3500402 Hehehehehe
3500500 …Did you ignore the warning?
3500501 …You killed Henrik?
3500502 But hey I'm glad I'm alive. You do it too.
3500503 And...it was you who killed Gascoigne here wasn't it?
3500504 Phew...
3500505 They were losing their minds... I guess it was self-defense...
3500506 Don't get your hands too dirty
3500507 You are a hunter. You have to hunt the beast.
3500508 You can leave the hunter-hunting to me...

3500702 Hehehehehe
3500800 ...What is it I never thought we'd meet again...
3500801 I messed up a little bit. I'm taking a break for a while.
3500802 Don't worry I put blood in it. Even an old hag can handle it.
3500803 ...I don't dream anymore. When I die that's it.
3500804 It's embarrassing but we should be careful.
3500805 ...But from now on you're my prey.
3500806 You go back. Don't lay hands on me...
3500900 ...From here on out my prey is
3500901 You go back. Don't lay hands on me...
3501000 ...You should listen to what the elderly have to say...
3501001 Well it's true that you helped me.
3501002 …But maybe it’s time for me to move on too…
3501003 Lately I've been reminiscing a lot about the past...
3501004 …
3501005 Hey you
3501006 I'll hand this over to you.
3501010 That's the hunter's job but it's not yours to carry.
3501011 Whatever you do it's up to you...
3501012 …Ah I’m starting to feel sleepy…
3501013 Sorry but I'm going to get some sleep...
3501014 Just a little bit...

3501063 Sorry but I'm going to get some sleep...
3501064 Just a little bit...
3501100 (Sleeping breath. Then it fades away as if taking its last breath.)
3501200 Was he drunk on the hunt consumed by the blood of the beasts?
3501201 Poor you.
3501202 The least we can do is execute him which is a sign of mercy in hunting...
3501250 Was he drunk on the hunt consumed by the blood of the beasts?

3501356 Kukukukukuku
3501400 (The sound of an attack. A large knife. "Humph!" "Haah!" "Kieee!" and several other types.)
3501500 (The sound made when damage is received. There are several types such as "Kuh" "Guh" and "Tsssh!")
3501600 (Death throes upon death. There are several types such as "Giiiiiiiiiiii!" and "Ugyaaaaah!")
3501700 How embarrassing you drunk.
3501701 Don't expose yourself in a shameful manner like an animal.
3501702 It's about being quietly executed.
3501703 You were a hunter too.
3501704 That's not what you really mean is it?
3501705 That's enough...
3501706 Nobody's gonna blame you...

3700150 …ah 20 A visitor after a year?
3700151 It was that kind of night after all...
3700200 If so you'd better turn back now.
3700201 It's hunting night. You wouldn't want to venture into a dangerous forest.
3700202 Come on go away go away!

3700306 … Something to keep in mind…

3902250 ...Traitor...
4200000 Oh by any chance do you know my sister?
4200001 I was supposed to be home alone but I can't see him anywhere...
4200002 A little girl with a big white ribbon
4200003 Do you know where it is?
4200050 Oh by any chance do you know my sister?
4200051 I was supposed to be home alone but I can't see him anywhere...
4200052 A little girl with a big white ribbon
4200053 Do you know where it is?
4200100 …Ah I thought so…
4200101 …Why is that girl going outside or something?
4200102 Ugh...
4200103 …But now I can pray for her.
4200010 Ugh...
4200200 A beautiful ribbon... it's finally mine...
4200201 It would suit you very well...
4200202 Uh-huh uh-huh-huh.
4200300 Ah how lovely...
4200301 Uh-huh uh-huh-huh.
4200400 …I see. I understand.
4200401 But if you find out anything could you let me know?
4200402 A little girl with a big white ribbon
4200403 …She’s my precious little sister…
4200500 …Oh what's wrong?
4200501 Did you find out anything about my sister?
4200600 Eek!
4300000 …You're a stranger aren't you?
4300001 But going out in the middle of a hunt... if you value your life don't do it.
4300002 Otherwise you will either be killed or you will become infected...
4300100 You don't understand. Beast diseases are a problem in this city.
4300101 You don't need to pretend to hunt...
4300102 There's no need to do such horrible things...
4300200 Ah it was you...
4300201 …
4300202 …Thank you that helped.
4300203 This epidemic is crazy. It's never been this bad before.
4300204 How many people have been infected?
4300205 …Maybe it's time to start relying on outsiders like you.
4300206 I'll give this to you so you can receive help as a hunter.
4300207 …I’m sorry this is our problem…
4300300 …Let me give you a word of advice.
4300301 You want to go to East Town?
4300302 The bridge leading to East Street is closed.
4300303 Maybe the church executioner is here too. Better stay away.
4300304 And the other road that leads to East Street the sewer is Father Gascoigne's territory.
4300305 The priest is a good hunter but when it comes to hunting animals he goes a little crazy.
4300306 So be careful. Don't provoke it too much.
4300307 Especially no fire. Priests hate fire...
4300308 No because I'm so scared...
4300309 I guess it can't be helped since that happened...
4300400 …There's no end to it
4300401 Everyone everyone is turning into a beast. How many people do I have to kill?
4300402 It's driving me crazy...
4300403 Ah I wonder if that child is safe...
4300404 …Stay safe…please…
4300500 …Ahh ahh…
4300501 …What is happening? My dear Elémer… (sobbing)
4300600 (Battle cry Slashing breathing ("Hmph!" etc.)
4300700 (When I was hit / few screams as they were slashed (e.g. being slashed shot with a shotgun etc.)
4300800 (Death throes at the time of death (They may groan and collapse or die with a loud scream etc.)
4300900 Stop it!
4300901 If you are still a man hear me out!
4300902 Hey! Stop it!
4301000 …I guess I’m already infected.
4301001 Well I guess that's ok.
4301002 …Just hunt.
4301100 …I wonder how long I can keep doing this…
4301101 This time something’s wrong…
4400000 Oh yeah is anyone listening?
4400001 Wow yeah wow!
4400002 It's the end for this town. It's finally time for revenge.
4400003 This is retribution for burning Valley Town burning the patients burning my wife and children and burning the beasts!
4400004 Oh joy this is the curse of the Holy Grail!
4400005 Gyahahahaha wow
4400100 Wow yeah you still want to listen?
4400101 I see the fire I hear the burning I smell the meat roasting.
4400102 This town will soon meet the same fate. The Holy Grail the symbol of Valley Town will surely curse them.
4400103 It is the curse of the great old gods!
4400104 Gyahahahaha wow
4400200 Wow yeah yeah wow
4400201 I know I know
4400202 The beasts of my Valley City they are the true form of man
4400203 That is the work of the blood of the old gods
4400204 Ah but why wasn't I chosen?
4400205 Am I the only person at the bottom of the well?
4400206 Is it at the bottom of the well?
4400300 Thou shalt not disturb the tomb of the Holy Grail. Thou shalt not disturb the tomb of the Holy Grail.
4400301 The white hollow grave keeper howls in a squishy manner.
4400302 Thou shalt not disturb the tomb of the Holy Grail. Thou shalt not disturb the tomb of the Holy Grail.
4400303 Blood relatives do not seek blood.
4400304 Thou shalt not seek blood
4500000 Oh good. You're awake aren't you? But don't push yourself just yet.
4500001 From treatment 1 You've been asleep for months your body is still not used to it right?
4500002 And tonight is another night of hunting.
4500003 You may not know because you are a stranger.
4500004 On days like that I stay home cover my ears and stay still.
4500005 If you do that then it will all be over
4500100 Oh. What's wrong you?
4500101 Maybe he's hungry?
4500200 Oh poor thing. But I'm in trouble. I've been hunting animals for so long and I've got nothing left to eat.
4500201 ...Yes here you go. It's nutritious and I think it will fill you up.
4500202 This may seem weird to outsiders but I'm sorry.
4500300 Really? If you'd like the same thing I'm sorry.
4500400 Well you see... sometimes a bad disease spreads in this town.
4500401 It's a disease of beast possession.
4500402 So when a disease spreads they hunt the animals.
4500403 In the dark of night without anyone knowing so there's nothing to worry about
4500404 Just leave it all to us. It's been going on for a long time in this town.
4500405 This time it's probably just a coincidence that the trend is terrible.
4500406 That should be over soon...
4500500 It's not really something you care about
4500501 Hunting is the hunter's job
4500502 Surely tonight the hunt will end.
4500600 …What is that? I don't know
4500601 Maybe someone smarter than you knows this...
4500602 Sorry I couldn't be of any help
4500700 Ah Mr. Lawrence! That's your friend.
4500701 Oh my how careless I was!
4500702 Mr Lawrence went to find a doctor for you.
4500703 already 2 A week ago
4500704 But the hunt started soon after that so maybe he's hiding somewhere?
4500705 I'll be back when the hunt is over.
4500706 I'm sure you're very happy to be awake.
4500707 I was so worried.
4500800 Hey you. Don't push yourself too hard.
4500801 Now that you've woken up you should take good care of your body.
4500900 (When I was hit / few screams as they were slashed (e.g. being slashed shot with a shotgun etc.)
4501000 (Death throes at the time of death (dying with a scream etc.)
4501100 …Oh my dear…
4501101 You've been infected too...
4501102 Poor thing...
4600000 Ufufufufufu
4600001 Now give me your blood
4600002 Great Lord to indulge in that thought.
4600003 Ufufufufufu
4600100 ...Hey don't you know?
4600101 Have you seen my head somewhere?
4600102 I can't find it for ages I just can't find it it's getting to me
4600103 Hey don't you know?
4600104 Oh I see! That's good. If you know that's good.
4600105 Thank you I want to thank you. Is there anything I can do to help?
4600106 Thank you you gave me hope.
4600107 Oh I see… I guess that’s true I can’t help it.
4600108 After all it's my head and I can't find it...
4600109 Ah where is it? Like my head...
4600200 ...Ha! ...Are we comrades? We are comrades.
4600201 Good you're safe. So what happened?
4600202 Do you need any help?
4600203 ...Well then comrades be careful.
4600204 Everyone else is our enemy. They're after knowledge.
4600205 Knowledge that no one knows that we don't know either... it's frightening and useless.
4600206 What is known is no longer divine knowledge...forget everything...
4600207 Don't forget that...
4600300 Wow! Wow!
4600301 Do you know the great universe? Do you know it?
4600302 Inside you inside me which do you think it is?
4600303 Oh! Oh! I see!
4600304 Well then let's go! Into you!
4600305 Oh! Oh! I see!
4600306 So come on welcome into me!
4600307 Oh! I see…
4600308 A new idea...worth forgetting...
4600309 Worth it... (muttering)
4600400 ...Hey do you remember?
4600401 When I was sand that's why I couldn't fly
4600402 And it still hasn't flown...
4600403 ...Hey you. You look like me when I was sand...

4700001 Ufu give me your blood
4700002 You want to make me your bride?
4700003 Ufufufufufu
4700004 Ufufu I'll think about your bride.
4700100 Ah my boy my boy!
4700101 Where have you been? Mom was worried about you.
4700102 Otherwise everyone will go somewhere else...
4700103 Come on let's have a meal
4700104 Oh you're full already
4700105 That was good that was good
4700106 You'll be back soon very soon...
4700107 Surely soon...
4700200 …Ah it rots. Slowly...

11000102 …And then he killed him…

11200101 So thin and fleeting. But it was my only reassurance amid the scent of blood and animals.

11300004 The League is a pact to eradicate all the filth that lurks on the night of the hunt.
11300005 If you're a hunter you probably feel the same way right?
11300006 Aren't you all sick of filthy beasts disgusting slugs and crazy medical professionals?
11300007 That's why I'm going to kill them all. The hunters of the Federation will cooperate with you.
